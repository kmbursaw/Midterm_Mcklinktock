## Introduction
Central Wisconsin is home to an unknown number of white deer. These deer have a recessive genetic trait that causes leucism, which is a lack of pigmentation, and they are almost fully white. The Wisconsin White Deer Tracker is an application for the general public, hunters, and the Wisconsin DNR to gain a better understanding of where the white deer are and how many there might be. People will be able to report a white deer sighting and view other sightings in their area through this application and Survey123.
